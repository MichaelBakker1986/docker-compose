Versionned FFL models

#How to transport DATA from model A into model B? (Other question, separate ModelName until answer)
#A) We might include a PUBLIC model....

#|sibling|  child
Data format:
 model|version|variable|property|formula
   KSP|      1|  Q_ROOT| formula|A[prev]
   KSP|      1|  Q_ROOT| sibling| Q_HULP
   KSP|      1|  Q_ROOT|   child|Q_MAP01
   KSP|      1|  Q_ROOT| visible|STATE=1
   KSP|      1| Q_MAP01|  refers|Q_MAP00
   KSP|      1| Q_MAP01| formula|    A+B

#1) Convert all into this format
#2) See delta vs previous version
#3) Store all and only changed data to new version
#4) Only send delta, let the client do the delta check

#Save FFL-> (!) file a fs is latest.
#   -> Validate FFL file
#   -> Bump version number
#   -> SaveToDisk(And STASH)
#   -> Save DELTA to DB
#
# First just bump the version number and include the version number in the API
# All created changes within the FFL in a running state are stored in the FFL Table, allowing versionning
#1) Load FFL into DB format.

#First test case: Save FFL to DB, make change Save FFLv2 to DB. See Delta saved.
#Both versions should be able to load
