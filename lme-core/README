#Idea behind XAxis:
Every variable(t0,t1,t2) can hold up to 256 values
 USER|DOC|{TREND|NOTREND|AGG}+
 First value is reserved for USER value, defined with the USER-Formula       - This could be MIN(Self[lastbkyear],100) to see all values from the last bookyear with a minimal value of 100
 Second value is reserved for the DOCUMENT value, with the 'default'-Formula - Often used for overall settings.
 Trend|NoTrend|AGG values are reserved for values in time The user decides when Trend|NoTrend starts and ends. Combined with aggregation formula's
  e.g.
0     (USER)
1     (DOCUMENT)
    2 (detail)
    3 (detail)
    4 (detail)
   5  (quart_bkyear) agg(2,3,4)
    6 (detail)
    7 (detail)
    8 (detail)
   9  (quart_bkyear) agg(6,7,8)
 10   (half_bkyear)  agg(5,9)
[.....]

Aggregation formulaset would be like If(FLOW,Self[prev])                  -- (!) previous column can be aggregation column
                                     If(BALANCE,SUM(Self[t.agg_columns])) --

Inverse aggregation:(~~similar to flip-flop) if(DataEntered(Self|Aggregated)) SUM(Self[agg]/fraction)
 -- So the formula for these types are more complex to perform.

Introducing valuation formulaset could be done in the USER- formulaset, when the USER-formulaset is already taken. We need to introduce another formulaset.
