1)DataEntered
1)TupleMax,TupleMin
2)All "T" functions. They are the X-axis.

  LastTInFormulaSet  t.lastInFormulaSet
  FirstTinFormulaSet t.firstInFormulaSet
  FirstTinPeriod     t.firstInPeriod
  LastTinPeriod      t.lastInPeriod
  LastTinYear        t.lastBkYear
  FirstTinYear       t.firstBkyear
  FirstT             t.first
  LastT              t.last
  TsY                t.tsy
