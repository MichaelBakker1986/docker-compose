deparse choices, works now with JSON.parse, can be way quicker
Charts work on variable name, so cyclic dependencies are shown when refering to other properties
Static properties can never be cyclic. They should be filtered out. (make new dependency type) deps/refs/

includes
.title dus, percentage spul (SectionType) number input (alles is nu dus string input) validatie misschien als het simpel is....
tuple identificeren en + laten zien
Aantal ingevulde verplichte velden (6) worden niet geupdate of zo
Navigatie aan the variable lookup koppellen bovenin
hoofdnode bovenin laten zien?
scrolltop

properties in formbuilder, locked / copy
make [0] and [1] work. title
Properties are provided from either the database for a specific data format, or from giving imports
Add dependency tree, while throwing elements away
Make autocomplete on variableNames, generic on top of page
process changes in Ace, and PropertyEditor
debug functionality in Ace
never load too many items on screen, just cut it off @ 200 rows. more is not interesting at all
add numeral
search & save to right mini buttons
we can preoptimize very easy, since ffl's are also generatedm their outcome is low level.producing false&&verycomplemethod(x)

parsers should not themselve add formula's, this making it complex
  - the JSWorkBook should do this while importing

parser tests are very simular, they all use integration test to validate the GenericModel
TODO: make a GenericParserTest
Code is written the rootNode always to be 'root', bad practise. also details of root node is lost in exports
too many CSS,js external resources, use a bundle

-- some setValue are called by the UI trying to refresh the pages, they result as NULL values in the expors

Lazy loading formula's/see preview in old version
V05 now taking 450ms to load, value,hint,visible,locked 12ms to json, 310to genericmodel
FIN
  - Function Gap
create FinanXML import

create Excel export/import
  - for model and values

FFL all properties
  - parsed value is translated back
  - ] should be } somewhere in the ffl
  - indenting for properties not the same as children
  - export tuple, variable modifiers=/-/+
  - add header and footer
  - formula: undefined.
  - removing all " and \ from fin, also the ones that mean something

  + free casing of variable fixing. there are some casesensitive mistakes in ffl

FinanXML support (out/in), Out First;
There is no indication for resource intensive actions,  (busy indicator Cg-Busy)
