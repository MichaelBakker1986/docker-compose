[BR][/BR][BR][/BR][BR][/BR]Factor Response Clarification Text:[BR][/BR][BR][/BR]WEAK: The borrower can exert influence over its suppliers, possibly specifying terms and setting prices with little opportunity for the supplier to dispute this. This situation often occurs where there are many suppliers with few customers, and the customers effectively control the market. Consider, for example, suppliers to the major auto manufacturers.[BR][/BR][BR][/BR]LIMITED: Individual suppliers have very little influence over the borrower. This situation would often occur where the individual ticket price is very high and where there are many suppliers and relatively few customers.[BR][/BR][BR][/BR]SOME: The relationship between each supplier and the borrower tends to be fairly equal. This may occur in situations where there are few suppliers and few customers. Each has a significant interest in maintaining the relationship and working with the other to resolve any issues.[BR][/BR][BR][/BR]SIGNIFICANT: It would be difficult for the borrower to switch suppliers to get better terms. This situation would often occur where there are relatively few suitable suppliers or where the borrower has invested heavily in a product and is reliant on the supplier for maintenance and upgrades.[BR][/BR][BR][/BR]STRANGEHOLD where the supplier is in a position to impose terms on the borrower. This situation may occur where the supplier has a monopoly situation or in markets where there are very few players with high barriers to entry[BR][/BR][BR][/BR][BR][/BR]Factor Evaluation Criteria:[BR][/BR][BR][/BR]How many suppliers available?

Previous adherence to stated commitments, how cash flow has been used in the past are assessed, including the record of balancing shareholder and debt holder interests and level of caution in management of the Borrower’s liquidity profile. Based on the  understanding of past actions, the incentives and pressures on management and its strategic goals, a subjective forward looking view is formed about likely future performance.

It is also expected for the Borrower to mitigate nearly all of the exchange risk via hedging contracts. The Borrower considers as a strategic objective maintaining a good credit rating with the Banks.[BR][/BR][BR][/BR]CONSERVATIVE - Expected to have a conservative and balanced financial policy with an ability and willingness to fund main requirements from internal sources. Most of the exchange risk is mitigated via hedging. The Borrower regards a good rating as important but not a strategic objective.[BR][/BR][BR][/BR]BALANCED - Expected to have a balanced financial policy however with potential for the use of internal cash flows to either make acquisitions or pay the Shareholders. The exchange risk is only partial hedged representing a potential source of risk.[BR][/BR][BR][/BR]RISKY - Expected to have a financial policy that is unfavourable to creditors. Alternate sources of liquidity are limited, or might even be unavailable, bank credit facilities maybe be fully secured with just with covenant cushion. Exchange risk is not correctly mitigated and any negative movement in the relevant exchange rates might place the Borrower into financial problems. [BR][/BR][BR][/BR]VERY RISKY - Expected to have financial policies, either by making acquisitions or activity expansions using most of the funds available and by remunerating the shareholders without ensuring a good level of liquidity, that could contribute to a high likelihood of Default.
