!-- EOV_CostPrice 			= CostPrice Variable (bookvalue)
!-- EOV_Investment 			= Investment Variable (how much was invested during a given period)
!-- EOV_DepreciationPeriod	= Depreciation Period Variable (how many years it will take for the investment to decline completely) (document level)
!-- EOV_ResultCalc 			= ExpandOriginalValue(EOV_CostPrice,EOV_Investment,EOV_DepreciationPeriod)

!-- test with one investment declining over time
Scenario: test with one investment declining over time
Given a document with timeunit MONTH for the forecast years 2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011
